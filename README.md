**ABOUT ME**

_Aspiring Front-End Developer | Research Enthusiast_

Hi there! I'm an enthusiastic front-end developer learning and exploring the world of web development. While I'm still honing my skills in various programming languages, I'm particularly passionate about creating user-friendly and visually appealing interfaces. Alongside my technical pursuits, I'm an avid researcher, always eager to delve into new topics and expand my knowledge base. <br> I'm currently focused on mastering front-end frameworks and technologies, but I'm also open to exploring other areas of web development as I continue my journey. I'm excited to collaborate with fellow developers and contribute to open-source projects, further immersing myself in the dynamic world of tech.
